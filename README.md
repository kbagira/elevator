# elevator
he Elevator Simulation project aims to create a basic simulation of an elevator system to understand its behavior under different conditions. The project simulates passenger calls, elevator movement, and provides analysis on various aspects of the elevator operation.
The program utilizes stack and map data structures to manage elevator requests and record floor call frequencies.
The program interacts with the user through the console, allowing input of parameters such as number of floors, maximum passengers per trip, and simulation duration.
Passenger calls are simulated randomly.
Analysis includes Maximum Number of Passengers in the Lift,Total Time Needed for All Calls,Frequency of Calls from Each Floor,Total Number of Passengers,Minimum Number of Passengers in the Lift,Peak Load Periods
